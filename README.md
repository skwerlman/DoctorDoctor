DoctorDoctor
============

This repo's more about nostalgia than functionality. When I was learning to code (on computers; I first learned on a TI-83), I was taught using UCBLogo, a neat little interpreted language with the goddamn ugliest syntax you've ever seen. Put another way, I got VERY good at debugging. One program I never figured out was called doctor. It was a simple chat bot that emulated a conversation with a psycologist. It worked rather well, considering the limitations of the language. I've decided to figure out how it works by translating it into Lua, a language I know how to read.

* UCBLogo: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html
* To run doctor after installing logo: cslsload "doctor doctor
(that's actually two commands, but whatever)
